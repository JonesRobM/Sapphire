The following molecular dynamics simulations can be found in this data folder:

AgNi:
Two independent freezing simulations of a randomly alloyed AgNi nanoparticle where 80% of the cluster is composed of Ag and 20% of Ni.
The process takes 14 ns with the temperatured decrementing by 50 K every ns from 1000 K to 300 K.

AuPd:
Two independent freezing simulations of a Janus AuPd nanoparticle where 80% of the cluster is composed of Au and 20% of Pd.
The process takes 14 ns with the temperatured decrementing by 50 K every ns from 1000 K to 300 K.

AuPt:
Two independent melting simulations of a randomly alloyed AuPt nanoparticle where 80% of the cluster is composed of Au and 20% of Pt.
The process takes 14 ns with the temperatured incrementing by 50 K every ns from 300 K to 1000 K.

CuNi:
Two independent melting simulations of a Janus CuNi nanoparticle where 80% of the cluster is composed of Cu and 20% of Ni.
The process takes 14 ns with the temperatured incrementing by 50 K every ns from 300 K to 1000 K.
