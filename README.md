Sapphire is a multi-faceted platform engineered to facilitate the design, of metallic nanoparticles in addition to computing their dynamics and energetics. Integrating these two aspects of nanoparticle simulation is the comprehensive set of analysis techniques offered by Sapphire which utilises pre-exisiting, highly-efficient, pythonic libraries such as ase (atomic simulation environment) and asap3 (as soon as possible).

Please, also be aware that Sapphire is still in a perpetual state of development. Should you recover any strange results, contact one of the authors of this document with any information you are able to provide about the problem and a hot-fix will be implemented if necessary. Otherwise, feedback on ease of use is always appreciated.

To get started, visit the Tutorials folder which will guide you through various different utilities of Sapphire 

Please check out our group page to learn more about the exciting work we do at the nanoscale!
